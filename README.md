# Railway Crossing Safety System

This project applies the **Engineering Method** to design a logic-based railway crossing gate safety system.  
It ensures gates lower automatically when a train is approaching or when a vehicle remains on the tracks, and only raise when the crossing is completely safe.

## 🚦 System Summary
- **Inputs:** Train sensor, Vehicle sensor, Manual Settings  
- **Outputs:** Gate state (Lowered/Raised), Warning Alarms/Signals 
- **Logic:**  
  - If train detected OR vehicle on tracks ; Gates lowered + warning signals  
  - If no train AND no vehicle ; Gates raised + signals off  
  - Includes safety buffer after train passes
