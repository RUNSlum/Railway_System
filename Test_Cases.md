# Test Cases â€“ Railway Crossing Safety System

The following test cases were used to verify the logic of the railway crossing safety system.  
Each test considers sensor inputs and expected outputs.

## âœ… Test Case Table

| Test Case | Train Detected | Vehicle on Tracks | Buffer Timer | Expected Output                         |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1         | Yes            | No                | No           |Gates Lowered + Warning Signals On       |
| 2         | Yes            | Yes               | NO           |Gates Lowered + Warning Signals On       |
| 3         | No             | Yes               | No           |Gates Lowered + Warning Signals On       |
| 4         | No             | No                | Yes          |Gates Lowered + Warning Signals On       |
| 5         | No             | No                | No           |Gates Raised + Warning Signals Off       |

## ðŸ”§ Refinements Suggested
- Add multiple sensors to improve reliability.  
- Include a manual override  for emergencies.  
- Adjust buffer waiting time depending on train speed.
